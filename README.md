# Clicky-Game

## Overview

This is a memory game with React.  For this game, I break up the UI into different components, manage component state, and respond to user events. Once the user clicks one card to start, all other cards are going to be reshuffled.

## How to play
The idea of this game is to click on any of the cards without clicking on the same one again. Once you click on the same card, which your Score will set back to 0. However, your Top Score still be there.
